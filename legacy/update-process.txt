About 1x year; last run, Jan 2021:
./get-vcal2.pl --zip=78721
(should get .vcal-data/78721-start-end.{ics,raw,txt})
If .vcal-data/78721-start-end.raw already exists, we'll skip the download
After fetching the raw file, processing is done via parse-vcal.pl (unless both the ics and txt files exist)

(e.g. 25 for Eastern, 210 for Hawaii)
Note the lat and lon in the location
Run ./closest-zip.sh lon lat (with format 080W15 25N47 OR -80.25543 25.7723)
Top entry from results should be closest
Update get-vcal2.pl and make sure time zone data as well as zip code map are updated
